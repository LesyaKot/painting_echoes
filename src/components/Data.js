  AboutTextParagraph1:
    " My name is Olha Kotkova — a Ukrainian artist and trained architect. I merge architectural precision with artistic intuition to explore the dialogue between space, form, and emotion — blending structure with creativity. Drawing has never been just a hobby for me — it is my passion and voice. Every color, every line, every composition reflects my inner landscape. My works are not simply images; they are fragments of my emotions, memories, and reflections of the world around me.",
